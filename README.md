In this web development task, the objective is to craft a dynamic website allowing users to select a team of three Pokémon for their adventures. Employing a combination of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and AJAX, the project promises an engaging and seamless user experience.

The HTML will lay the foundation for the structure, featuring an intuitive interface where users can browse through a catalog of Pokémon. CSS will be leveraged to enhance the visual appeal, ensuring a vibrant and user-friendly design. JavaScript will play a pivotal role in making the website interactive, allowing users to select and visualize their chosen Pokémon.

To further elevate the user experience, AJAX will be implemented to facilitate asynchronous communication with a server, ensuring smooth data retrieval and updates. This dynamic approach allows users to seamlessly add or remove Pokémon from their team without refreshing the entire page.

The end result will be a captivating and responsive website, where Pokémon enthusiasts can easily assemble their dream team of three, fostering an immersive and enjoyable online experience for fans of these iconic creatures.
